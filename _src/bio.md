title: About Me

Mat “Wilto” Marquis is an amateur boxer, [aspiring chef](https://wiltomakesfood.com), halfway decent carpenter, and passable antique British motorcycle mechanic—when not making fast, accessible, responsive websites. He keeps busy.

As chair of the Responsive Issues Community Group, Mat spearheaded the effort to bring native responsive image solutions to the HTML5 specification, later going on to facilitate browser implementations and oversee the addition of native responsive image techniques to major CMSes. He has spoken at An Event Apart, edited for A List Apart, and published JavaScript for Web Designers and Image Performance with A Book Apart. He even had the honor of appearing in the film What Comes Next is the Future, to discuss his role in web standards. He has an IMDB page and everything!

Just—… just ignore the other thing on there.

Long story.
